# express-pug-webpack-boilerplate

This is a bare-bones SSR Pug project that's been bundled with Webpack and served via Express. 

Pug converts the code into HTML after compilation, and then Express renders them via its views API. 

Webpack has been used for bundling, particularly with the CSS pre-processors being used (Sass). You can take out the sass/css packages and loaders if you plan to use vanilla CSS.
